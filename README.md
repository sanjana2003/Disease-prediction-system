# Disease-prediction-system
The Multiple disease prediction system using Machine Learning
Introduction:
A streamlit web application for predicting multiple disease , and heart disease using Machine Learning Algorithms. For this project python library for building interactive web application

Diseases prediction for :
1. Diabetes
2. Parkinsons disease
3. Heart disease

Features:
User Input: Users can input their medical information, including age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors.
Disease Prediction: The application utilizes machine learning models to predict the likelihood of having diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease based on the inputted medical data.
Prediction Results: The predicted disease outcomes are displayed to the user, providing an indication of the probability of each disease.
Visualization: Visualizations are generated to highlight important features and provide insights into the prediction process.
User-Friendly Interface: The web application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for individuals without technical knowledge to use the prediction tool.
