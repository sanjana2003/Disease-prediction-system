INTRODUCTION:
             This project provides a streamlit web application for predicting multiple diseases, including diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease, using machine learning algorithms. The prediction models are deployed using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web application.

FEATURES:

The Multiple Disease Prediction web application offers the following features:

User Input: Users can input their medical information, including age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors.

Disease Prediction: The application utilizes machine learning models to predict the likelihood of having diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease based on the inputted medical data.

Prediction Results: The predicted disease outcomes are displayed to the user, providing an indication of the probability of each disease.

Visualization: Visualizations are generated to highlight important features and provide insights into the prediction process.

User-Friendly Interface: The web application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for individuals without technical knowledge to use the prediction tool.
